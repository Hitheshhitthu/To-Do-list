# To-Do-list
Description:
This To-Do List web app is built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript to allow users to manage tasks efficiently. Users can add new tasks using an input field and mark them as complete by clicking on the task, which applies a strike-through effect. Each task includes a delete button for easy removal and supports inline editing through double-clicking. The app uses localStorage to save tasks so that they persist even after the page is refreshed. Overall, it demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic state management in a clean and responsive UI.
